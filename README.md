# V8 Internals - A Security Nerd's Prespective

## Abstract
Open source softwares are inherently trusted by users & developers. This is especially true for modern web-browsers like Chromium, which touches user's personal data very frequently. However, browsers are hard to secure, inherently complex machines. Most browsers have their own memory management and system software, almost like an operating system. In this study we present internals of V8 engine, which is the Javascript engine powering Chromium web-browser. We analyze the major components in depth and then dive into taint-tracking implementation / previous vulnerabilities in order to explore the current landscape in a systematic way. Our intent is to provide a one stop location to understand the core V8 internals, while looking for opportunities for improvement from a security perspective. 

## Introduction
The twenty first century can be thought of as a century of open source software. From industrial systems all the way to your microwave might be running a version of an opensource software. While we use a lost of open source software indirectly, web browsers is a unique kind of software. From an application perspective, it allows us to interact with the world and do anything from sending an email, all the way to stream videos and games via cloud. On the software end, Chromium does it's own memory management, has builtin interpreter and compiler which compiles code generated by an internal CSA code. Chromium has characteristics of an application software and system software all at once.

We trust our Web browser all of our personal data. But where does our trust come from? While it is open source, it is important that some formal verification keeps going into the system<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>. Google does pretty good job regarding this with their bug bounty system<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>. However, the Chromium's codebase changes a lot all the time and hence it's very important that we keep the bar low enough so that new developers find it easy to get started with Chromium and improve on it's security.

The goal of this study is to make such contributions of a significant component of Chromium, its Javascript engine V8. V8 has historically been
